# 3D-Vector-objects
3D vector objects in Java.

The program deals with 3D vectors and operations on them. There are two classes. The point class creates a 3D point object and the vector class creates a 3D vector from the point object. Following are the operations the can be performed on the vectors:

- Printing the two vectors.
- Calculating the sum of two vectors.
- Calculating the difference of two vectors.
- Calculating dot product of two vectors.
- Calculating the length of two vectors.
- Calculating the angle of cosine of two vectors.
